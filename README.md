Hi Andro,

I have used Javascript, Custom Workflow (Code) activities, and plugins to sync the data.  I have excluded business rules and BPF to keep it consistent.  Custom Workflow activities to handle batch processing.   However, ideally, it should move to flow (power automate) in future.  No access to CDS or flow in trial version.  Connectivity is limited in the trial version, and performance is slow as well.  I have committed the code and solution files (export) on each task where applicable.  Since I could not deploy plugins in trial, i have not uploaded solution files for these.  instead the code is available here on GitHub.  I have used a virtual machine (CRM 2016) to test the rest of the code outside of the trial instance due to trial limitations and time.

I have used this trial instance available for 30 days: https://org6e693e73.crm4.dynamics.com/.  
*Authentication details can be provided if required.  
But solution files and code repo can be used to re-install in the target environment as well.

Please note questions 1-4, 8, and 9 were done in trial instance, at customization and JS level.  Mostly code activities were used for questions 5-8 outside of trial.  Question 10 was a plugin on Pre-Event (Outside of Trial).  Question 11, is a readMe file uploaded here to GitHub

Constraints:
1. Trial instance has limitations, connectivity to SDK from XrmToolBox or Plugin Registration Tool.  
2. Trial Instance performance is slow.
3. May not have access to Power Automate and CDS in Trial.  However, Power Automate as i mentioned in first interview, i am aiming to upskill in this area over next few months.  However code activities are still applicable in latest version of CRM Online.

*solution has been testd and working, either in Trial or local VM.

Thanks.  Overall it was a nice test.  It was fun and good practice!  Structured well.

Regards
Yash
